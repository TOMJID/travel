# 📱 Mobile-First Philosophy

</div>

**Designed from the ground up for mobile users:**

Instead of building for desktop and “squeezing” it down, this page starts with the smallest screen in mind and progressively enhances layouts with media queries for larger sizes.

This ensures:

- Content stacks vertically on small screens
- Transforms into multi-column grids and side-by-side layouts on larger viewports
- Prioritizes performance and readability
- Intuitive navigation with future JS enhancement potential (e.g., hamburger menu)
